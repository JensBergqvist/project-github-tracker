# GitHub Tracker
This week we were asked to build a github tracker for our Technigo projects. 


## The problem
I had massive problems with showing my commits. Whenever I invoked the code to display it, several of my projects disappeared. I needed to make an if else statement to be able to display all the projects.


## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
